## Issues and Recommendations

### 🔧 PRIORITY 1 - Critical Fixes Needed

#### 1. Accessibility Improvements
**Issue:** Enter key doesn't trigger button activation  
**Impact:** High - Keyboard users cannot fully interact  
**Fix:** Add `onKeyDown` handler for Enter/Space keys
```javascript
const handleKeyDown = (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
    handleTest();
  }
};
```

#### 2. Touch-Friendly Sizing
**Issue:** Button exactly 40px height (minimum threshold)  
**Impact:** Medium - Touch accessibility concerns  
**Fix:** Increase button padding to ensure >44px minimum
```css
className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded" // Increased padding
```

### 🔧 PRIORITY 2 - Performance Enhancements

#### 1. Core Web Vitals Measurement
**Issue:** LCP and FCP showing as 0 (measurement timing)  
**Impact:** Low - Metrics collection, not actual performance  
**Fix:** Adjust measurement timing in tests

#### 2. Meta Tags and SEO
**Issue:** Page title mismatch in tests  
**Impact:** Low - Test expectations need updating  
**Fix:** Update test to expect actual title

### 🔧 PRIORITY 3 - Future Enhancements

#### 1. Advanced Animations
**Opportunity:** Add micro-interactions for premium feel  
**Benefit:** Enhanced user experience, brand differentiation  
**Implementation:** CSS transitions for hover states, loading animations

#### 2. Progressive Web App Features
**Opportunity:** Add PWA capabilities for mobile experience  
**Benefit:** App-like experience, offline capabilities  
**Implementation:** Service worker, manifest.json, caching strategy
